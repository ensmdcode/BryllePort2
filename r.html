The 1st Quarter of ICT was a rough trip full of ups and downs, which might have made it enjoyable and terrible for me. Coding is quite fun when you fully understand it but I failed many activities in this subject. I've had many technical problems with my laptop during hands-on and I doubt I would get a high grade in ICT but that doesn't bother me that much considering that it's still 1st Quarter and there are still so many things to explore and discover. I prefer to be optimistic because you never know what good things can happen to you in the future, I'm getting out of topic so let me get back to the main topic. These lessons can serve as the foundation for more complex codes and I'm excited to apply what I learn in future activities. <br><br>

2nd Quarter was a confusing trip at first but became quite easy after some time. We were finally exposed to an undiscovered treasure called CSS, a feature that gives a pirate like me powers to design my browser to be visually appealing and user friendly. In web development, it emphasizes the value of structure, style, and flexibility. CSS has shown me how minor changes like changing the colors or margins of the content may have a big influence on the user experience. It also shortens html codes which saves a lot of my time in making web browsers like this E-Portfolio and stressful performance tasks done in school. It has also highlighted the need of perseverance and trial and error because debugging and fixing styles frequently call for creative thinking and problem-solving skills. In general, CSS develops not only technical proficiency but also creativity and attention to detail, two qualities that are essential for creating engaging digital experiences.
